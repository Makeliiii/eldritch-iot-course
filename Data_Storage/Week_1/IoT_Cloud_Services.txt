Personally I can already confidently say that I would choose AWS as my cloud service provider for an IoT application as AWS is the platform I'm most familiar with. Amazon has an incredibly scalable platform and is able to support a multitude of different devices and the massive amount of interactions between them. Their pricing is based on messages sent and received by Amazon IoT, where each interaction can be thought of as one message between the device and server. Amazon also has a software development kit to support developers in building applications that run on the AWS platform.

Microsoft Azure has a bunch of tools for IoT applications. They have cloud storage, machine learning, IoT services, and even developed their own OS for IoT devices. Microsoft's pricing is done in 4 tiers, where below 8000 messages per unit per day is free. While calculating the prices seemingly does get difficult once you start integrating other Microsoft services, their great pricing calculator is there to help you out with that.

Google is also a big player when it comes to serious IoT service providers. Google's main focus is making thing fast and easy for the user/business while offering "Google grade" security. Using this platform also allows the user to take advantage of Google's private global fiber network. Google prices its services on a per-minute basis. Google's platform is usually a bit cheaper than AWS and even has a price comparison tool to show how much the user is saving. Google also has its own IoT OS, just like Microsoft.
