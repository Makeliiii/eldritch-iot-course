SQL should work fine for an IoT application if the data harvested by the sensors is relational. SQL is also a mature technology and has been around for a long time so a lot of the issues the application might have probably also have a solution already. SQL is also very versatile and could provide a good supplement to the IoT system with its' joins, aggregations, and window functions.

Data from sensors can vary quite a bit, making SQL a tad bit hard to work with since it was designed for relatively static data. Sensor data provides a continuous stream, which could make time series based databases a better choice.
