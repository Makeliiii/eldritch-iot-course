1)  Classification
    Classification specifies the class to which data elements belong to and is best used when the output has finite and discrete values.

2)  Target
    Target is the final output being predicted. It can be categorical (true/false) or continuous (number/string/i.e).

3)  Feature
    Features are variables that act as the input in your system.

4)  Predictor
    Predictors are the input data or the variables mapped to the target variable through an empirical relationship usually determined through the data.

5)  Regression
    Regression techniques are used when the output is real-valued based on continuous variables.
